## **3. SUMMARY**
Hello to all who read this summary. My name is Ivan, I'm 21 years old. Even at school, I realized that I wanted to connect my life with programming and made many attempts. By nature, I am a very calm, Executive and friendly person. Easily and most importantly quickly succumb to learning, if laziness does not get the better of me :) And now I want to change my thinking style and because of this I started studying frontend.
